# 📊 Visualizing Uncertainty in EV Registration Data

This project explores and visualizes uncertainty in U.S. electric vehicle (EV) registration data from 1980 to 2023. It combines traditional statistical tools with custom-designed glyphs and network visualizations to highlight variability, reliability, and structural patterns in registration records across different vehicle types and registration periods.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Uncertainty in EV Registration Data.pdf`: Final project report

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Represent the **uncertainty** in EV registration counts across time and vehicle categories
- Create **interactive and visual tools** to communicate variability to non-technical audiences
- Provide **insights** for policymakers, planners, and analysts in the transportation and EV infrastructure sectors

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data preprocessing and custom glyph generation
- **Gephi** – Network visualization and force-directed layouts
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** – Box plots and uncertainty overlays
- **Adobe Illustrator / Inkscape** (optional) – Fine-tuning visuals for presentation

---

## 📈 Visual Techniques Used

### ✅ Network Visualization with Gephi

- Nodes represent vehicle types and registration periods
- Edges illustrate relationships; **thicker edges** = stronger certainty
- **Color and opacity** indicate uncertainty levels

### ✅ Custom Glyph Design (Python)

- Arrows and dots encode uncertainty using:
  - **Color**: Red = high uncertainty, Orange = medium, Green = low
  - **Opacity & thickness** for emphasis
  - **Blurry shapes and error bars** to represent variability

### ✅ Box Plots with Error Bars

- Show distribution of EV registrations over time
- Visualize interquartile range, medians, and outliers
- Highlight how variability increases in recent years

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- EV adoption has grown significantly since 2010, aligned with policy and tech shifts
- Registration uncertainty increases in recent years due to higher adoption volume
- Network patterns reveal relationships between vehicle types and registration durations
- Custom glyphs make it easier to communicate uncertainty at a glance

## 💡 Why This Matters

This project demonstrates how **visual analytics and glyph design** can help interpret complex datasets with uncertainty. For planners, analysts, and policymakers, understanding not just the numbers but also their **reliability** is crucial for making effective infrastructure and incentive decisions.
